        <b>
        <li>Giant panda looks cuddly and cute when you search photos on the internet. But it's much bigger than you think. An adult panda weight more than 45 kilos (100 pounds), and can be about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long!</li>
        <li>Giant pandas can't stand and do kung fu moves like Po in Kungfu Panda. But they are good tree climbers. They can climb trees from 7 months old. Giant pandas are bears, and like other bears, they can swim.</li>
        <li>Pandas are born looking like baby badgers â€” fur-less, pink, and blind. The iconic black and white colour comes later, after about three weeks. Not all giant pandas are black and white! A few are brown and white, but these are very rare.</li>
        <li>"The looks of a teddy bear" are what makes pandas so popular. Pandas appeal to our "cuteness receptors" because they have large, front-facing eyes, and are extremely furry, so we therefore think of them as cuddly and cute.</li>
        <li>One reason for pandas being rare is that breeding is not high on their list of priorities. And with only a one-day window a year for a female to conceive naturally, it is hardly surprising that pandas are an endangered species.</li>
        <li>A 45-kilo adult (and pandas can reach 150 kg in captivity) spends as long as 14 hours eating. And it can eat 12 to 38 kilos of bamboo a day.</li></b>
